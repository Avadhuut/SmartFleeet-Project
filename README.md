SmartFleet is a backend system designed to simplify fleet management operations.
It consists of multiple Spring Boot microservices — including Fleet, Driver, Trip, Tracking, Alert, Analytics, and Auth services — communicating via REST APIs and Kafka for real-time data handling.

The project demonstrates microservice architecture, inter-service communication using Feign Client, centralized configuration, and event-driven design.
